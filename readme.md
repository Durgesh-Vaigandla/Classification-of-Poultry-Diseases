# Transfer Learning-Based Classification of Poultry Diseases for Enhanced Health Management

## Overview
This project uses transfer learning to classify poultry diseases into four categories: Salmonella, New Castle Disease, Coccidiosis, and Healthy. The system integrates a robust machine learning model with a mobile application, allowing farmers to diagnose diseases through symptoms, environmental conditions, and biological samples data input, receiving immediate diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

## Features
- Real-time disease classification using transfer learning
- Four-category disease identification (Salmonella, New Castle Disease, Coccidiosis, Healthy)
- Mobile application interface for easy data input
- Immediate diagnosis results
- Suggested treatment protocols
- User-friendly interface for farmers

## Technologies Used
- Deep Learning / Transfer Learning
- Computer Vision
- Mobile Application Development
- Cloud-based Model Deployment

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/poultry-disease-classification.git

# Navigate to the project directory

# Run the application
python app.py
```

## Usage
1. Open the mobile application
2. Input observed symptoms
3. Add environmental data
4. Upload images if available
5. Submit for analysis
6. Receive diagnosis and treatment recommendations

## Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Outbreak in a Rural Community
A small rural community relies heavily on poultry farming for its livelihood. Recently, the farmers have noticed an increase in sick birds, exhibiting symptoms such as lethargy, diarrhea, and reduced egg production. Without immediate access to veterinary services, the farmers are struggling to diagnose the problem. Using the new mobile application, they input the observed symptoms and environmental data. The machine learning model quickly classifies the disease as Coccidiosis and provides recommendations for treatment and management. This allows the farmers to take swift action, reducing the spread of the disease and preventing further economic losses.

### Scenario 2: Commercial Poultry Farm Management
A large commercial poultry farm has implemented the machine learning-based disease classification system to monitor the health of its flocks. Daily health checks are performed, and data is collected via the mobile application. One day, the system identifies symptoms consistent with New Castle Disease in a specific section of the farm. The early detection enables the farm management to quarantine the affected birds and implement control measures promptly, preventing a widespread outbreak and ensuring the overall health of the flock. This proactive approach not only saves costs but also maintains the farm's productivity and reputation.

### Scenario 3: Research and Training for Veterinary Students
A veterinary school integrates the machine learning-based disease classification application into its curriculum. Students use the app to input data from case studies and real-world scenarios. Through this hands-on training, they learn how to diagnose diseases like Salmonella, New Castle Disease, and Coccidiosis using modern technology. The application also provides detailed information about each disease, treatment options, and management practices. This experience equips future veterinarians with valuable skills in utilizing advanced diagnostic tools, preparing them to better serve the poultry industry.
